# Welcome to Ledmington's personal repository
This repository is an archive for my personal little projects. Too little to get each one a dedicated repo. These programs are mostly implementation of strange data structures or algorithms to beat some real-world games. I usually implement these in a day or two, just for fun. For this reason, they may have some serious bugs. If you happen to find one, please let me know.

I hope you'll find something useful :)

## Contents
- [36_cards](https://github.com/Ledmington/personal/tree/main/36_cards) is a little Python script that calculates the probability of winning a card solitaire game called "36 cards".
- [crawler](https://github.com/Ledmington/personal/tree/main/crawler) is a little Python script that randomly explores all web pages, starting from one link and looking for new URLs inside the HTML code received.
- [magicsquare](https://github.com/Ledmington/personal/tree/main/magicsquare) is a parallel C+OpenMP program that searches non-trivial magic squares.
- [mergesort](https://github.com/Ledmington/personal/tree/main/mergesort) is a performance comparison between 5 different C implementations of the Merge-Sort algorithm.
- [mincorr](https://github.com/Ledmington/personal/tree/main/mincorr) is a little C program that finds the array with minimum correlation with a given array.
- [orologio](https://github.com/Ledmington/personal/tree/main/orologio) is a little Python script that calculates the probability of winning a card solitaire game called "Orologio" (the clock).
- [paroliere](https://github.com/Ledmington/personal/tree/main/paroliere) is a C implementation of a brute-force algorithm that finds all possible italian words in a game of "Paroliere" (it's very similar to Ruzzle).
- [quad_tree](https://github.com/Ledmington/personal/tree/main/quad-tree) is a performance comparison between serial and parallel implementations of the naive algorithm and a quad-tree when counting the collisions between some 2D circles.
- [secret_code](https://github.com/Ledmington/personal/tree/main/secret_code) is a C implementation of an algorithm that wins the game "Secret Code" against you (the game is similar to Mastermind).
- [trie](https://github.com/Ledmington/personal/tree/main/trie) is a C implementation of the "Trie" data structure.
- [word_guesser](https://github.com/Ledmington/personal/tree/main/word_guesser) is a simple C game that guesses your word through binary search.
- [xor](https://github.com/Ledmington/personal/tree/main/xor) contains the 128, 256 and 512-bit implementations of the simple XOR hash algorithm.
